## **Final Phase III Results**

We initially tried to achieve the parameterization without any RTL changes by just modifying the parameters and the analysis and results for that experiment are documented in the notebook.

Since there are only RTL changes at this step we report only the before and after mIPC numbers. These are as follows - 

Program | mIPC before | mIPC after
------- | ----------- | ----------
bs | 365 | 365
fibcall | 447 | 447
median | 414 | 414
rv64ui-p-blt | 303 | 303
towers | 749 | 749
vvadd | 754 | 754

As can be seen above, both the before and after mIPC values are the same and this is because of the fixed refill width and the multiplexing that we use in our modifications. The detailed analysis is given in the project notebook.

## **Final Phase IV Results**

In Phase 4, we ran our backend flow with I$ having a 16kB/4-way configuration and the D$ having a 8kB/2-way configuration. We summarise the final power, performance and area numbers below and make a comparison with the baseline design.

For a detailed analysis of each of these metrics, please refer to the project notebook.

### **Performance**
Baseline Clock Frequency | Modified Clock Frequency | % Change
------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------
142.87 MHz | 151.08 MHz | 5.7%

### **Power**
We present the power for the *bs* program as a reference
              Baseline Power Metrics (uW)        |               Modified Power Metrics (uW)
------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------
Internal Power | Switching Power | Leakage Power | Internal Power | Switching Power | Leakage Power
-------------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------
46200 | 9160 | 7570 | 43800 | 9060 | 5740

In terms of the total power - 
Baseline total power = 62930 uW
Modified total power = 58600 uW
% Change = 6.88%

### **Area**
All areas are in um^2
Baseline Area | Modified Area | % Change
------------- | ------------- | --------
2656075.6 | 1865011.8 | 29.7%
